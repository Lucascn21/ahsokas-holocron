            This is a tecnical MVP that uses the

            to fetch and display data about the Star Wars universe. It is built
            with Next.JS and Tailwind CSS.
          </p>
          <p>
            The app is a work in progress, meant to be a scalable baseline and
            will be updated as me, and hopefully a group of friends, take upon
            the challenge to learn more about Next.JS and Tailwind CSS.

          <p>
            I wasnt able to implement a solid filter function to the characters
            page, although I managed to get it to work at one point, it felt
            like a hacky solution.ðŸ˜¿ <br />
            Therefore it will be a feature to implement in the next sprint as
            the team grows.ðŸ˜‰
